{"name":"Spotify, how long is my playlist?","tagline":"Calculates the duration of a Spotify playlist.","body":"### So you want to know how long your Spotify playlist is?\r\n\r\nSpotify doesn't have a feature to calculate the length of a playlist. It's kind of annoying. Calculate the length of a Spotify playlist with this script.\r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\n - Spotify API key *pretty sure this requires a premium account*\r\n - Spotify username\r\n - Spotify password\r\n - [libspotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/) (installed by [Hallon](https://github.com/Burgestrand/Hallon) if possible)\r\n - Ruby Gems\r\n - Ruby 1.9.3 or higher (probably will work with 1.8.7)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### How to use\r\n\r\n1. ```$ git clone https://github.com/feministy/spotify_playlist_duration.git```\r\n2. Get a Spotify API key from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/keys/)\r\n3. Download the binary file and save it in the same directory as this repo\r\n4. ```$ export SPOTIFY_USERNAME='your_username'```\r\n5. ```$ export SPOTIFY_PASSWORD='passwordy'```\r\n6. Grab the Spotify URI of the playlist you want to find the length of\r\n7. ```$ export SPOTIFY_LIST='spotify_uri'```\r\n8. ```$ bundle install```\r\n9. ```$ bundle exec ruby calculate.rb```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note** Sometimes the Spotify API is a little finnicky and it will return nil. Wait a few seconds/minutes and try again.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
